Assignment 1 - Command Line Interpreter

Homework is to be completed individually. Send your zipped source code and executable file to me via Canvas
Be sure to include your name at the top of each source file submitted. For example:
 // ConsoleApplication1.cpp : Simple Command Line Interpreter.
 
Interactive Shell:
Write a C/C++ program to implement an interactive shell in which users can execute commands. Call this program 
myShell. Create an infinite loop (while(1)) that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a command (see example output 
and input below). Consider using fgets() to read a line of input from the user. Before executing the command entered 
by the user, the command must be compared against the list of supported commands shown here:
dir
help
vol
path
tasklist
notepad
echo
color
ping

Since some commands require more than one argument (e.g. echo, color, ping), you will need to parse the user input 
into its arguments. Consider using the strtok() function.
For example:
COMMAND TYPED BY THE USER:
ping 192.168.1.1
ARGUMENT 0: "ping"
ARGUMENT 1: "192.168.1.1"

If the command in argument[0] is in the list above, your program must execute the command in a child thread via 
CreateThread(). In other words, create a child thread that executes the command. The parent thread waits for the 
child to terminate. If the user types exit or quit, your shell should simply terminate. Sample output and input are 
shown below:
Welcome to myShell
==> dir
Volume in drive C is Windows

Thanks for using myShell!

Assumptions: Assume arguments within myShell do not contain spaces. In other words, don't worry about parsing 
out quoted strings in your argument list. You may assume that no more than four arguments will be used on the 
command line (i.e. similar to argv[0], argv[1], argv[2], and argv[3]).
